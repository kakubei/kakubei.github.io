      <p>When your wife yells at you: “Another video game? You bought another video game? We need a new sofa and you bought another fucking video game???” You hold up you hand, palm out, and in a very calm voice, your best Ted Talk voice, you say: “It’s for the kids.” Of course, it’s all bullshit, it’s not for the kids, the kids would not be allowed anywhere near such a video game.

      <p>So it’s that time of the year again, the new year and back to work after the Christmas holidays, chock full of new year’s resolution waiting to be dashed against the rocks of every day life and humdrum routine. Resolutions that will, inevitably, succumb, to quote the poet Ace Ventura, to the chewy chunks of degradation.

      <p>My advice: don’t! Don’t get me wrong, London is wonderful place, it is the centre of the universe, it is the most cosmopolitan and interesting city in the world (sorry New York). It has the most things to do anywhere on the planet. You could live in London your entire life and never see or do everything there is to see or do. It is the Silicon Valley of Europe.

      <p>So if you’ve ever used a Tap Gesture on a whole ViewController only to find that it interferes with a TableView and now you can’t select any rows, you know how it can be a pain. The good news is that there is a really simple way to fix it. You don’t need to create any weird invisble views, etc. Just add this bit of code in viewDidLoad: tap.cancelsTouchesInView <span... <a href="/2016/02/24/Tap-Gesture-and-TableView/">read</a> </p>

But the one I like the most and I think is the simplest is to just force an end editing like so: view.endEditing(true) Put it into a function and call it from multiple places in your ViewController: <figure... <a href="/2016/02/24/Close-iOS-Keyboard/">read</a> </p>

      <p>So what’s a guy to do when Rdio shuts down? Apart from freak out and tear your hair out and then mourn and cry? What alternatives are out there? If you’re lucky to live in a country where Pandora is available, then that’s probably your first option. Not because Pandora is any good, but because they bought the last assets Rdio had to offer. If it’s not available then there’s Spotify. But I don’t really like it. The interface sucks,... <a href="/2016/02/05/Apple-Music-HipHop/">read</a> </p>

What good is a timepiece that can’t fulfill its one, major, function: telling time, half the time?

      <p>Apple’s new language is undoubtedly much more palatable and approachable than the dreaded Objective-C, no question about that whatsoever. Even if you’re a staunch, die-hard, crusty old Objective-C developer you have to admit that Swift is more elegant, less verbose (hell, even a 6-year-old girl is less verbose), easier to remember and, more important: easier to learn than Objective-C. It is Apple’s latest attempt at bringing a modern language to its modern Operating System. But it’s no panacea. Granted, this... <a href="/2014/11/15/swift-is-a-mess/">read</a> </p>

            Best Way to Close the iOS Keyboard

        <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2016</span>

        <p>I’m sure you’ve seen lots of different ways of closing the keyboard in iOS. One of the most popular ones seems to be to resign the first responder. And that one’s fine. But the one I like the most and I think is the simplest is to just force an end editing like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="n">view</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">endEditing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Put it into a function and call it from multiple places in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">ViewController</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">closeKeyboard</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">view</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">endEditing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Maybe call it after a tap anywhere in your main view:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">tap</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">UITapGestureRecognizer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">target</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">action</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"closeKeyboard"</span><span class="p">)</span>
