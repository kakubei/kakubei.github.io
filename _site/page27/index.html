      <p>When your wife yells at you: “Another video game? You bought another video game? We need a new sofa and you bought another fucking video game???” You hold up you hand, palm out, and in a very calm voice, your best Ted Talk voice, you say: “It’s for the kids.” Of course, it’s all bullshit, it’s not for the kids, the kids would not be allowed anywhere near such a video game.

      <p>So it’s that time of the year again, the new year and back to work after the Christmas holidays, chock full of new year’s resolution waiting to be dashed against the rocks of every day life and humdrum routine. Resolutions that will, inevitably, succumb, to quote the poet Ace Ventura, to the chewy chunks of degradation. I’ve been gearing myself for this return to work and the inevitable stress that comes with it, for the past two days. Mentally preparing,... <a href="/2017/01/15/back-to-work/">read</a> </p>

      <p>My advice: don’t! Don’t get me wrong, London is wonderful place, it is the centre of the universe, it is the most cosmopolitan and interesting city in the world (sorry New York). It has the most things to do anywhere on the planet. You could live in London your entire life and never see or do everything there is to see or do. It is the Silicon Valley of Europe. It’s also the banking capital of Europe. And it’s also... <a href="/2017/01/14/move-to-london/">read</a> </p>

      <p>So if you’ve ever used a Tap Gesture on a whole ViewController only to find that it interferes with a TableView and now you can’t select any rows, you know how it can be a pain. The good news is that there is a really simple way to fix it. You don’t need to create any weird invisble views, etc. Just add this bit of code in viewDidLoad: tap.cancelsTouchesInView <span... <a href="/2016/02/24/Tap-Gesture-and-TableView/">read</a> </p>

      <p>I’m sure you’ve seen lots of different ways of closing the keyboard in iOS. One of the most popular ones seems to be to resign the first responder. And that one’s fine. But the one I like the most and I think is the simplest is to just force an end editing like so: view.endEditing(true) Put it into a function and call it from multiple places in your ViewController: <figure... <a href="/2016/02/24/Close-iOS-Keyboard/">read</a> </p>

      <p>So what’s a guy to do when Rdio shuts down? Apart from freak out and tear your hair out and then mourn and cry? What alternatives are out there? If you’re lucky to live in a country where Pandora is available, then that’s probably your first option. Not because Pandora is any good, but because they bought the last assets Rdio had to offer. If it’s not available then there’s Spotify. But I don’t really like it. The interface sucks,... <a href="/2016/02/05/Apple-Music-HipHop/">read</a> </p>

      <p>Who knew? I’ve written disparagingly about Swift in the past, but as I dig deeper and deeper into the language, and with the new 2.0 version just out, I’ve come to like it more and more.

      <p>I’m an old Apple fan boy, but I don’t like the Apple Watch, I don’t own one and don’t want to own one. I think it’s a gimmick. What good is a timepiece that can’t fulfill its one, major, function: telling time, half the time?

      <p>For some years now I’ve been obsessed with To Do apps. I think it’s safe to say that anyone obsessed with technology, as I am, will also be obsessed with things like To Do apps since they represent the epitome of technology’s promise: to make our lives easier. Now, I’m not talking about a grocery list in a table view, that’s easy to do, you can whip one up in a number of programming environments with not too much effort,... <a href="/2015/06/05/Irony-of-To-Do-Apps/">read</a> </p>

      <p>Apple’s new language is undoubtedly much more palatable and approachable than the dreaded Objective-C, no question about that whatsoever. Even if you’re a staunch, die-hard, crusty old Objective-C developer you have to admit that Swift is more elegant, less verbose (hell, even a 6-year-old girl is less verbose), easier to remember and, more important: easier to learn than Objective-C. It is Apple’s latest attempt at bringing a modern language to its modern Operating System. But it’s no panacea. Granted, this... <a href="/2014/11/15/swift-is-a-mess/">read</a> </p>

It cost me $200 which is a lot for an independent developer these days, especially when you consider that Xcode is free and they’ve just released Swift, a much more approachable language than the daunting and hated Objective-C. Hell I even bought the Rubymotion book by Clay Allsop in my excitement. But their website said that it was a one-time investment... <a href="/2014/09/26/Rubymotion-maintenance/">read</a> </p>

            Rails 4.1 upgrade

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2014</span>

        <p><strong><a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/4_1_release_notes.html">Rails 4.1</a> is out</strong> and it has some very nice changes, enough to want to make you upgrade immediately, but beware of some issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Issues with <a href="https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/squeel">Squeel</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/burke/zeus">Zeus</a> vs <a href="https://github.com/rails/spring/blob/master/README.md">Spring</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">sidekiq</a></li>
  <li>Issues with JSON and views</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="squeel">Squeel</h3>
<p>Rails 4.1 and Active Record have a lot of issues with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Squeel</code>, and by that I mean that your app will fail to load until you’ve put this into your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'polyamorous'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">github: </span><span class="s1">'activerecord-hackery/polyamorous'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">branch: </span><span class="s1">'rails-4.1'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You’ll see lots of places where people say that this is enough for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Polyamorous</code> to work:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'polyamorous'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">github: </span><span class="s1">'activerecord-hackery/polyamorous'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That might have been true at some point, but now you need to add the `branch: ‘rails-4.1’ directive or <strong>you’ll get an error in bundle trying to load the gem,</strong> something like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">Could</span> <span class="n">not</span> <span class="n">find</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">valid</span> <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'polyamorous'</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">~&gt;</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">any</span> <span class="n">repository</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You’ll see an error like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">undefined</span> <span class="nb">method</span> <span class="s1">'graft'</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="s1">'ActiveRecord::Associations::JoinDependency'</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="no">NameError</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If the above gem doesn’t clear it, put this in as well:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'activeadmin'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">github: </span><span class="s1">'gregbell/active_admin'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The tough thing is that there is very little indication that it is Squeel that is causing the error so it’s hard to track. I love Squeel, I use it on all my Rails and Padrino apps, but that’s the problem with gems that <code class="highlighter-rouge">hack</code> other gems, things can get hairy.</p>

<p>Ernie Miller, the guy who created Squeel, has moved all of gems into a new github repository appropriately called <a href="https://github.com/activerecord-hackery">activerecord-hackery</a>, you might find some more info there, the bad news is he is not maintaining them anymore, so we’ll have to wait and see if other developers take over the job or we’ll be forced to remove Squeel from all our projects or not upgrade past a certain point.</p>

<p><strong>Beware:</strong> right now, even after those changes, you might get errors like <code class="highlighter-rouge">wrong number of arguments (3 for 2)</code> for queries that worked fine before with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Squeel</code>. If this is the case, <em>you are currently screwed</em>. You can either lock down <code class="highlighter-rouge">ActiveRecord to 4.0.4</code> or remove all traces of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Squeel</code> in your code. Neither is an appealing prospect, but of the two I think I would choose to remove <code class="highlighter-rouge">Squeel</code> since <code class="highlighter-rouge">ActiveRecord</code> is an integral part of Rails.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> in fact, that’s just what I had to do, I removed all traces of Squeel from both the applications I had. It took me a couple of days and was a real pain in the arse, but in the end, it was better than relying on a gem that is no longer maintained and one for which there isn’t a clear fix.</p>

<h3 id="sidekiq">Sidekiq</h3>
<p>Sidekiq has also made a number of changes under the hood in version 3.0.0. We have 2 projects using it and I had to revert to version 2.17.4 because upgrading would require a number of rewrites to our code which I’m not ready for yet, they don’t seem to be huge changes, but after fighting with Sidekiq for a while in our production app (since the errors did not show up in Development) I gave up for the time being and will address them down the line.</p>

<p>The upgrade read me is <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/3.0-Upgrade.md">here</a></p>

<p>I had 2 errors, the first one was easy to fix:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">NameError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">uninitialized</span> <span class="n">constant</span> <span class="no">Sidekiq</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Stats</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Just put this at the top of the file that calls Sidekiq:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'sidekiq/api'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This wasn’t required in version 2.17.4 so it’s a bit weird, but hey that fixed it.</p>

<p>The second error:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">ArgumentError</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">wrong</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">arguments</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="c1"># for this line</span>
<span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">worker_instance</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">msg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">queue</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It turns out that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3rd party gems which use client-side middleware will need to update due to an API change. The Redis connection for a particular job is passed thru the middleware to handle sharding where jobs can be pushed to different redis server instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you’re now supposed to do something like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">worker_instance</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">msg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">queue</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">redis_pool</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Again, not a huge change, but it does require some rewrites, and those are the 2 I found, there’s no guarantee that if I fix those others won’t crop up.</p>

<h3 id="zeus-vs-spring">Zeus vs Spring</h3>
<p>These are both preloading libraries to make your Rails faster and your life better. Zeus has been around for a while and it’s great, it’s even integrated into Rubymine which is awesome. So what’s the issue? you ask just stick with Zeus. I am but Spring is now integrated into Rails 4.1 by default and it’s always nice to be able to use out of the box solutions, especially ones built by people smarter than you.</p>

<p>If using Rubymine, just make sure to use version <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.13.4-pre2</code> of Zeus.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'zeus'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'0.13.4.pre2'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This last one is not really and issue since it’s only applicable in a development environment but you should be aware of it so you don’t run into problem when upgrading. Pick one of the two and stick with it.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve had several issues with Zeus freezing up on me so I’ve since removed it as well from all my apps, (sigh).</p>

<h3 id="json">JSON</h3>
<p>This one might not affect you because it’s a very specific issue:</p>

<p>If you have a table with a column named <code class="highlighter-rouge">format</code> and you want to use it in any view (web page) as JSON you are screwed, you will get the following error:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">	<span class="n">too</span> <span class="n">few</span> <span class="n">arguments</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it, nothing else, no hint as to where this is happening. It turns out it is any time you try to output that table data into a view using JSON. So if you had something like this for example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">	<span class="no">BookFormat</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">format: </span><span class="s1">'paperback'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">as_json</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Which is perfectly valid and produces something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">	<span class="no">BookFormat</span> <span class="no">Load</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="n">ms</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="no">SELECT</span> <span class="sb">`book_formats`</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">*</span> <span class="no">FROM</span> <span class="sb">`book_formats`</span>  <span class="no">WHERE</span> <span class="sb">`book_formats`</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">`</span><span class="nb">format</span><span class="sb">` = 'paperback'  ORDER BY format
[{"id"=&gt;3, "format"=&gt;"Paperback"}]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You will get the <code class="highlighter-rouge">too few arguments</code> error. Which seems to be triggered by Active Record 4.1.1:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">	<span class="n">activemodel</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">lib</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">active_model</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">serialization</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">rb</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">108</span><span class="ss">:in</span> <span class="sb">`block in serializable_hash'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As of May 20 I’ve found no solution to this but to go back to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Rails 4.0.4</code>.</p>

<h3 id="procrastination-conclusion">Procrastination conclusion</h3>

<p>I actually upgraded to 4.1.1 and had most things working but have had to downgrade because of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">JSON</code> issue.</p>
