      <p>When your wife yells at you “Another video game? You bought another video game? We need a new sofa and you bought another fucking video game???” You hold up you hand, palm out, and in a very calm voice, your best Ted Talk voice, you say: “It’s for the kids.” Of course, it’s all bullshit, it’s not for the kids, the kids would not be allowed anywhere near such a video game.

      <p>So it’s that time of the year again, the new year and back to work after the Christmas holidays, chock full of new year’s resolution waiting to be dashed against the rocks of every day life and humdrum routine. Resolutions that will, inevitably, succumb, to quote the poet Ace Ventura, to the chewy chunks of degradation.

      <p>My advice: don’t! Don’t get me wrong, London is wonderful place, it is the centre of the universe, it is the most cosmopolitan and interesting city in the world (sorry New York). It has the most things to do anywhere on the planet. You could live in London your entire life and never see or do everything there is to see or do. It is the Silicon Valley of Europe.

      <p>So if you’ve ever used a Tap Gesture on a whole ViewController only to find that it interferes with a TableView and now you can’t select any rows, you know how it can be a pain. The good news is that there is a really simple way to fix it. You don’t need to create any weird invisble views, etc. Just add this bit of code in viewDidLoad: tap.cancelsTouchesInView <span... <a href="/2016/02/24/Tap-Gesture-and-TableView/">read</a> </p>

But the one I like the most and I think is the simplest is to just force an end editing like so: view.endEditing(true) Put it into a function and call it from multiple places in your ViewController: <figure... <a href="/2016/02/24/Close-iOS-Keyboard/">read</a> </p>

      <p>So what’s a guy to do when Rdio shuts down? Apart from freak out and tear your hair out and then mourn and cry? What alternatives are out there? If you’re lucky to live in a country where Pandora is available, then that’s probably your first option. Not because Pandora is any good, but because they bought the last assets Rdio had to offer. If it’s not available then there’s Spotify. But I don’t really like it. The interface sucks,... <a href="/2016/02/05/Apple-Music-HipHop/">read</a> </p>

What good is a timepiece that can’t fulfill its one, major, function: telling time, half the time?

      <p>Apple’s new language is undoubtedly much more palatable and approachable than the dreaded Objective-C, no question about that whatsoever. Even if you’re a staunch, die-hard, crusty old Objective-C developer you have to admit that Swift is more elegant, less verbose (hell, even a 6-year-old girl is less verbose), easier to remember and, more important: easier to learn than Objective-C.

            Ajax and Rails, making it work
          </a>
        </h2>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2014</span>

        <p>Every time I need to add some Ajax to a Rails project I need to look up documentation and search through all my earlier files to see how I did it. Maybe this is because I’m old and was doing javascript (which I hate BTW) the old-fashioned way so getting my head around the Rails way might be more difficult, I don’t know, but it’s a pain in the arse, so I’m writing a little blog post so I can refer to it and hopefully it’ll help other people too.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>To me, Ajax in Rails is needlessly convoluted, but here’s how it works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You create a link with <code class="highlighter-rouge">link_to</code> and set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">remote</code> option to <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code></li>
  <li>In your controller, for that link, create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">format.js</code> response</li>
  <li>Create a javascript file with the same name as the method the link responds to</li>
  <li>In that javascript file, put the <code class="highlighter-rouge">js</code> code you want Rails to execute when you click the link</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>This is a simple issue where I need to hide or show a column based on the value of a cookie which I’ve previously put into an instance variable:</p>

<p>The link</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1"># 1</span>
<span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;span class='btn btn-sm btn-primary'&gt;eye-icon&lt;/span&gt;"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">html_safe</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">users_flip_show_dogtag_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">title: </span><span class="n">icon_title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">remote: </span><span class="kp">true</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The controller method</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1"># 2</span>

<h2 id="pitfalls">Pitfalls</h2>
<p>Beware of comparing integer values inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">js.erb</code> files, you might get a <strong>missing method error</strong> when the javascript helper tries to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">gsub</code> on the integer:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="no">NoMethodError</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">undefined</span> <span class="nb">method</span> <span class="s1">'gsub'</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="ss">:Fixnum</span><span class="p">:</span>
       <span class="n">actionpack</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">lib</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">action_view</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">helpers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">javascript_helper</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">rb</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">27</span><span class="ss">:in</span> <span class="s1">'escape_javascript'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This sucks because it means you can’t use integers for anything you need to then equate in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">js.erb</code> file but I don’t know of a workaround.</p>

<h2 id="reloading-a-dom-element">Reloading a DOM element</h2>
<p>If you want to reload part of the page, it gets even more convoluted because you need to create a Rails template that you can call to render only that portion. Rails calls this the ‘unobtrusive’ way, but it really fragments your views and you end up with as much as 5 files to edit just to get this to work, let’s count them:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">routes</code> file, you’ll need to add a route for the link</li>
  <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">controller</code> file that the link method calls</li>
  <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">view</code> file that shows your data</li>
  <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">js.erb</code> (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">coffescript</code>) file that contains the actual javascript code</li>
  <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Rails partial</code> file that you want to refresh</li>
</ol>

<p>Not what I would call unobtrusive at all but there you go.</p>

<p>So in our earlier example, lets refresh part of the page.</p>

<h3 id="refreshing-part-of-the-page">Refreshing part of the page</h3>
<p>All of the above stays the same, but we need 2 things to make the refresh happen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>an <code class="highlighter-rouge">element</code> that we will refresh</li>
  <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Rails partial</code> that will contain the data that we will <em>reload</em></li>
</ol>

<p>In our view file we create an element (generally a div) that we will refresh, it might look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1"># 1</span>
<span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">collection</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">flip</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">switch</span>
  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="s1">'layouts/flip_collection_state'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The Rails partial</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="o">-</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">cookies</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:show_library_dogtags</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">to_i</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
   <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">dogtag_icon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;i class='icon-eye-open'&gt;&lt;/i&gt;"</span>
 <span class="o">-</span><span class="k">else</span>
   <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">dogtag_icon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;i class='icon-eye-close'&gt;&lt;/i&gt;"</span>
 
<span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;span class='btn btn-sm btn-primary'&gt;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">dogtag_icon</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&lt;/span&gt;"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">html_safe</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">users_flip_show_dogtag_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">title: </span><span class="n">icon_title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">remote: </span><span class="kp">true</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The bit in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">js.erb</code> that actually refreshes the DOM element:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'.collection-flip-switch'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">html</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"&lt;%=j render 'layouts/flip_collection_state' %&gt;"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case the partial only contains a link and the logic to represent the right icon depending on a cookie value (I’ve stripped some other code that also gets refreshed to keep things simple).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, not very unobtrusive at all and too many moving parts to remember every time.</p>

<p>Feel free to refer to this nifty guide the next time you need to use Ajax in Rails, I know I will :)</p>
