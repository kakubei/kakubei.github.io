      <p>When your wife yells at you: “Another video game? You bought another video game? We need a new sofa and you bought another fucking video game???” You hold up you hand, palm out, and in a very calm voice, your best Ted Talk voice, you say: “It’s for the kids.” Of course, it’s all bullshit, it’s not for the kids, the kids would not be allowed anywhere near such a video game.

      <p>So it’s that time of the year again, the new year and back to work after the Christmas holidays, chock full of new year’s resolution waiting to be dashed against the rocks of every day life and humdrum routine. Resolutions that will, inevitably, succumb, to quote the poet Ace Ventura, to the chewy chunks of degradation. I’ve been gearing myself for this return to work and the inevitable stress that comes with it, for the past two days. Mentally preparing,... <a href="/2017/01/15/back-to-work/">read</a> </p>

      <p>My advice: don’t! Don’t get me wrong, London is wonderful place, it is the centre of the universe, it is the most cosmopolitan and interesting city in the world (sorry New York). It has the most things to do anywhere on the planet. You could live in London your entire life and never see or do everything there is to see or do. It is the Silicon Valley of Europe. It’s also the banking capital of Europe. And it’s also... <a href="/2017/01/14/move-to-london/">read</a> </p>

      <p>So if you’ve ever used a Tap Gesture on a whole ViewController only to find that it interferes with a TableView and now you can’t select any rows, you know how it can be a pain. The good news is that there is a really simple way to fix it. You don’t need to create any weird invisble views, etc. Just add this bit of code in viewDidLoad: tap.cancelsTouchesInView <span... <a href="/2016/02/24/Tap-Gesture-and-TableView/">read</a> </p>

      <p>I’m sure you’ve seen lots of different ways of closing the keyboard in iOS. One of the most popular ones seems to be to resign the first responder. And that one’s fine. But the one I like the most and I think is the simplest is to just force an end editing like so: view.endEditing(true) Put it into a function and call it from multiple places in your ViewController: <figure... <a href="/2016/02/24/Close-iOS-Keyboard/">read</a> </p>

      <p>So what’s a guy to do when Rdio shuts down? Apart from freak out and tear your hair out and then mourn and cry? What alternatives are out there? If you’re lucky to live in a country where Pandora is available, then that’s probably your first option. Not because Pandora is any good, but because they bought the last assets Rdio had to offer. If it’s not available then there’s Spotify. But I don’t really like it. The interface sucks,... <a href="/2016/02/05/Apple-Music-HipHop/">read</a> </p>

What good is a timepiece that can’t fulfill its one, major, function: telling time, half the time?

I think it’s safe to say that anyone obsessed with technology, as I am, will also be obsessed with things like To Do apps since they represent the epitome of technology’s promise: to make our lives easier.

      <p>Apple’s new language is undoubtedly much more palatable and approachable than the dreaded Objective-C, no question about that whatsoever. Even if you’re a staunch, die-hard, crusty old Objective-C developer you have to admit that Swift is more elegant, less verbose (hell, even a 6-year-old girl is less verbose), easier to remember and, more important: easier to learn than Objective-C. It is Apple’s latest attempt at bringing a modern language to its modern Operating System. But it’s no panacea. Granted, this... <a href="/2014/11/15/swift-is-a-mess/">read</a> </p>

It cost me $200 which is a lot for an independent developer these days, especially when you consider that Xcode is free and they’ve just released Swift, a much more approachable language than the daunting and hated Objective-C.

            Setting up git with SSH to update your site on push
          </a>
        </h2>

        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2014</span>

        <p>Due to the immense popularity of this blog, I’ve received thousands of requests on how to properly setup git with a regular hosting provider to publish your site with just a <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push</code> command. *</p>

<p>* <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is an unashamed lie, <em>thousands</em> of requests is a bit of an exaggeration, nobody reads this shit, so it was actually more like 0 requests. But hey, Dipak Chopra and the rest of the <em>The Secret</em> crew assure me that if you send your positive wishes to the Universe they will all come true (or some crap like that), so this is me putting my positive vibes out there.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you were so enthralled by my <a href="http://localhost:4000/2014/04/09/blogging-software/">brilliant piece on blogging software</a> that you can’t wait to try <a href="jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to create your very own blog. But you don’t want any plain vanilla, crappy blog, you want the whole enchilada, all-you-can-eat, hog-wild blog. Well, once again, I’m here to help you.</p>

<p>First things first. Let’s install Jekyll</p>

<h2 id="installing-the-jekyll-gem">Installing the Jekyll gem</h2>
<p>Open up a terminal session (Applications/Utilities/Terminal), then type this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">jekyll</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now we have the gem that does all the magic.</p>

<h2 id="lanyon">Lanyon</h2>

<p>Now let’s get the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Poole Lanyon</a> variant which has some nice styles to get you started. You can either clone the repository by <code class="highlighter-rouge">cding</code> in the Terminal over to where you want your blog to be and typing this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/poole/lanyon
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you don’t know what the above means or the Terminal scares the heebie-jeebies out of you, just click the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon/archive/master.zip">Download ZIP</a> link right here, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grab the unzipped folder</li>
  <li>put it where you want your blog to live</li>
  <li>rename it to something sensible and original like <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog</code></li>
  <li>and edit it with your preferred editor. I suggest <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">SublimeText</a> or <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">Rubymine</a> if you do any Ruby programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enable-git">Enable git</h2>
<p>If you’ve never used git, it’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">version control system</a> which means it basically helps you keep various versions of your files so that world won’t end when you make horrible mistakes and completely screw up your program. Not that any of us would <em>ever</em> do that.</p>

<p>Back in the terminal, <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> over to where your blog lives and types this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git init
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That enables git.</p>

<h2 id="add-files-to-git">Add files to git</h2>
<p>Now we need to add the files that we want to track. You can pick and choose which files to track and that’s always recommended, but since this isn’t a git tutorial, it’s a <em>Just give me my damn blog already</em> tutorial, we’ll just add everything to git.</p>

<p>Still in the terminal, type this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add -A
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>this adds everything in the current folder. This means all your files are now being tracked.</p>

<h2 id="commit-changed-or-new-files-to-git">Commit changed or new files to git</h2>
<p>Every time you are happy with your changes to a file you need to commit them to git, telling git that you want it to remember the state of this file. Git doesn’t do this automatically. <em>you must commit your changes to git every time</em>. But we haven’t changed anything! I hear you say. True, but we did just add some new files and you also need to commit new files. So, <code class="highlighter-rouge">changed or new file = commit</code>, got it?</p>

<p>Terminal time, type this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">    git commit -m <span class="s1">'initial commit'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-m</code> stands for <code class="highlighter-rouge">message</code>. Each time you make a commit, make sure to add a descriptive message of what you changed. This is really useful for when you need to go back and see where you messed up.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the git commands <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">here</a>.</p>

<p>Enough with git, let’s move on.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-to-github-pages">Publishing to github pages</h2>
<p>If you want to publish your blog to github pages for free, follow their excellent tutorial <a href="https://pages.github.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you already have a website and would like to publish your blog there for whatever reason, continue reading.</p>

<h2 id="ssh">SSH</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">ssh</a>, or secure shell is, as its name implies, a secure shell. It’s a secure way for computers to communicate over a network (usually the Internet) without having to use passwords and without people being able to sniff what they’re saying to each other. Actually, that’s technically incorrect, but I don’t want to explain what a shell is, etc. so just go with it for now.</p>

<p>We’ll use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> to publish our blog to our remote server on the internet. In order to do this, we need to create secure keys so that the computers can trust each other. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> can be daunting but just follow along and it doesn’t have to be. Also, don’t be afraid of <strong>the Terminal</strong>, it is actually your friend.</p>

<p>* Another Disclaimer: the first s in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> stands for secure, so security is very important when you’re dealing with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> otherwise it sort of defeats the purpose. Below, I’m recommending you don’t use a passphrase just because it’s easier to setup and use, but please do <a href="http://jimmyg.org/blog/2008/beginners-guide-to-ssh-keys-with-ssh2.html">read more about ssh</a> and be conscious of security issues. And no, you can’t sue me if your computer gets hacked.</p>

<h2 id="create-ssh-keys">Create SSH keys</h2>
<p>We’re going to create those keys on your computer. Let’s go back to our friend the Terminal.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-keygen
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It will prompt you for the location to save the keys, just hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">enter</code> to choose the default of <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh</code> which is fine.
Next it will ask you to enter a passphrase, this is optional, it’s basically so no one else can look at your keys or do anything with them without this passphrase, to make things easier we won’t add a passphrase here, once again, hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">enter</code> when prompted for the passphrase.</p>

<p>This will create your private and public keys <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> respectively.</p>

<p>The magic happens when we add our public key, <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to the remote server. Your private key, don’t copy it anywhere, leave it alone where it is, don’t touch it, don’t even look at it. OK you can look at it, all I’m saying is don’t copy it over to anywhere, leave it unmolested.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-ssh-keys-for-multiple-users">Multiple SSH keys for multiple users</h2>
<p>What if I have multple users for different web sites? You might have one user for your computer and another user for your personal site, yet another user for your work site, one more for your Heroku project, this is not unusual, I have a bunch of websites and I use a different user for each because I’m not a <strong>total</strong> idiot. Having one user and password for everything might be a lot easier but it’s just asking for trouble.</p>

<p>If you do have multiple users, just generate the keys with:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">    ssh-keygen -C <span class="s2">"user-name"</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="copy-the-public-key-to-your-remote-server">Copy the public key to your remote server</h2>
<p>We need to copy our public key over to the remote server where you have your site. In my case it’s Site5 and they make you request shell access before you can login with ssh so you might have to do that on your server, find out how to connect remotely to it. You can usually do it with the user and password you used to setup the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FTP</code> for your website.</p>

<p>We need to copy the public key to a file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">authorized_keys</code> in the server.</p>

<p>The easiest way to copy your public key to the remote server is probably to <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo</code> (or print it) from the command line over to the remote server. It also has the added benefit of making you feel like a hacker badass. Terminal please and type:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user-name@mysite.com ‘cat – &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys’
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Of course, change <code class="highlighter-rouge">user-name</code> for your user name and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mysite.com</code> with your site URL.</p>

<p><strong>If the above doesn’t work</strong>, do it manually. Once again in Terminal type this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This will print out your public key, which starts with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh-rsa</code> and ends with your user name. Copy the whole thing, then ssh over to your server with:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh user-name@mysite.com
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>once there see if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> exists, if it doesn’t create it with:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir ~/.ssh; touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; chmod 700 ~/.ssh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now open <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> with your favourite terminal editor like Emacs or Pico or Nano, paste your public key and save and close the file.</p>

<p>Congratulations, if you made it through all this you should be able to login to your site without providing a password, awesome. Get yourself a beer, you earned it.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-the-site">Publishing the site</h2>
<p>We’re almost done, now we need to setup git to publish our site remotely. I know I said that we were done with git and were moving on. I lied, we need one last thing with git, but this is it I promise, after this you’re <em>almost</em> done and will have a wonderful way to publish your awesome Jekyll blog very soon.</p>

<p>OK, let’s go. We need to tell git where our remote server is this requires 2 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a git folder where we can put the files on the remote server</li>
  <li>Set up git to push your changes to it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step-1-create-remote-repository">Step 1: create remote repository</h3>
<p>Still in your remote website, choose a place to put your files. This is not the folder where your site will be, git requires its own folder to put its own files, not your published web files, and type this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir blog.git
# this creates the folder where the git files will live
cd blog.git
git init --bare
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The last command will create an empty git repository so that when we push git won’t complain.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-tell-git-where-to-push-changes">Step 2: tell git where to push changes</h3>
<p>Back on your computer we need to tell git where to push the changes, the easiest ting to do is to go to the Terminal and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> over to where your blog is and type this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git remote add origin user-name@mysite.com:remote_blog_directory
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">remote_blog_directory</code> is the name of the folder you created in Step 1 above. And of course, change <code class="highlighter-rouge">user-name</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mysite.com</code> for your user and site name.</p>

<p><strong>If the above doesn’t work or you want to do it manually</strong>, you need to edit this file <code class="highlighter-rouge">.git/config</code> in your blog folder. This file is hidden so use whatever you have on your Mac to show you empty files, an easy way to do this is to go to the Finder and hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">Command-Shift-G</code> which will prompt you for a path, type this in the path: <code class="highlighter-rouge">path_to_my_blog/.git</code>.</p>

<p>If you installed SublimeText you can also type this in the Terminal: <code class="highlighter-rouge">subl path_to_your_blog/.git/config</code> and it will open that file for editing.</p>

<p>Git now knows where to publish your blog</p>

<h2 id="tell-git-not-to-prompt-you-for-a-password">Tell git not to prompt you for a password</h2>
<p>This should only be necessary if you have multiple users, if not you can probably skip it.</p>

<p>We’ll need to edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/config</code>, not <code class="highlighter-rouge">.git/config</code> in the root of your blog, but your personal <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ssh/config</code> file. You’ll find this file in your user’s folder, that’s what the little squiggly thing <code class="highlighter-rouge">~</code> (called <code class="highlighter-rouge">tilde</code> in English for those of you interested) means.</p>

<p>Open that file up with any editor, you can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SublimeText</code> trick above, and type something like this in it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Host mysite.com
  HostName mysite.com
  IdentityFile /Users/user-name/.ssh/id_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">IdentityFile</code> value is the private key, not the public one, the one <strong>without</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">.pub</code> at the end.</p>

<p>Since we already setup <code class="highlighter-rouge">SSH</code> before, it won’t prompt you for a password when you push your git changes.</p>

<h2 id="tell-git-to-copy-our-files-to-the-website-folder-after-we-push">Tell git to copy our files to the website folder after we push</h2>
<p>OK there is one last thing to do before we can push our site with git and see our hard-earned rewards, we need to tell git that every time you publish a change to your site, it needs to copy all the files from its internal repository and over to the folder where your website actually exists. This is easily accomplished thusly.</p>

<p>On the remote server, go to the folder we created in Step 1, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> over to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.git/hooks</code> folder. You will find a bunch of files there, the one we want is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">post-receive.sample</code>. Copy a version of it so we can edit it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cp post-receive.sample post-receive
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now edit it (again with whatever editor you have on the remote server) and put this into the file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">    <span class="nv">GIT_WORK_TREE</span><span class="o">=</span>/home/user-name/public_html/ git checkout -f</code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case, replace not only <code class="highlighter-rouge">user-name</code> with your user on the remote server but also <code class="highlighter-rouge">public_html</code> with whatever folder you’re using to serve your blog. For example, if the blog is in <code class="highlighter-rouge">public_html/blog</code> then put that in there.</p>

<p>This hook tells git to copy everything over to that folder every time you push a change.</p>

<h2 id="pushing-our-changes-and-publishing">Pushing our changes and publishing</h2>
<p>Alright, this is it, the final command to publish your site! Yay.</p>

<p>Create a new post in your local blog, something earth-shattering like <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello world</code> and let’s push that baby.</p>

<p>Go to your old fiend the terminal, still in the folder for your blog (on your computer, not the remote server) and type this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push origin master
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If all the planets are aligned, you should see a message saying everythig was successful.</p>

<p>Now visit your site on a browser and bask in the fruits of your hard labour. I know I’m mixing my metaphors but this occasion merits it, we’ve done <strong>a lot</strong> of hard work and now it’s time to enjoy it. Get yourself 2 beers this time, minimum.</p>

<p>The good news is that from now on, the only thing you need to do is:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">    git commit -m <span class="s1">'added new post (or whatever)'</span>
    git push origin master</code></pre></figure>

<p>And your site will be updated. Remember the <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> command is to actually commit the changes to git. If we don’t commit them and try to push something git will tell us there is nothing to push.</p>

<h2 id="gui-alternatives">GUI alternatives</h2>
<p>You love git but hate the Terminal? Use <a href="http://www.git-tower.com">Tower</a>, a wonderful app for all your git needs.</p>

<p>If you use Rubymine, it has built-in control for git so you can add, commit and push without ever touching the command line terminal.</p>

<p>I hope this actually helps someone. If it does, drop me a line in the comments section below.</p>

<h2 id="coming-soon">Coming Soon</h2>
<p>In a next installment I shall reveal the secrets to all the changes I made to this blog so you can be as cool as me ;)</p>
