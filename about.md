### What is this site?

My blog, mostly about programming but also a lot of random stuff that I feel like bitching/talking about, you'll even find stories here as well.

### Is it PC?

No, I use a Mac, ha, ha. If you mean `Politically Correct`, then **absolutely not**. If you're easily offended by cursing or bitching or ranting or truth-telling, bugger off now, this ain't Sesame Street.

### Don't you already have a blog on blogspot.com?
Yes, right here: [kakubei.blogspot.com](kakubei.blogspot.com) but blogger.com doesn't support Markdown so I got fed up with it, I'm thinking about transitioning everything over to this one.
