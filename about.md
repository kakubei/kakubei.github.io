### What is this site?

It's a novel I'm writing, served up serialized, which is a fancy word for 'in chapters'. Apparently, it's all the rage nowadays, though it's nothing new, Charles Dickens did it way back in 1837 or thereabouts.

### Why is this site so 'simple'

Because it's written in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) a really nice Ruby gem to create blogs. No PHP, no databases, no user authorization, just you and your words (after the struggle to get it running of course). You write all posts and pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want to) and use git to push the changes. Awesome.


### So you're writing your novel in chapters like Dickens so people will compare you with him?

Yes! Actually no! I don't think it's a fair comparison by any stretch of the imagination. For Charlie of course. Ha.

Seriously though, nothing to do with Charlie, I'm writing it in chapters because it's not done yet so as I finish and edit the chapters I'll post them up here. It's also a great way to get feedback and for an unpublished 'author' to be known and get his work out there.

### Who are you?

Just some random dude.

### Do I know you?

No.

### Have you published anything before?

No. That's what unpublished author means.

### So why should I read your crap?

Cause it's awesome? I don't know, fine, don't read it, bugger off. Or give it a try before you bugger off, you might like it. I'm writing the kind of novel I like to read, hopefully some other people like it too.

### But who are you really?

Alright, a little bio: I've done all sorts of things professionally. Worked as a tourist guide in the caribbean; then an English teacher; then a night watchman in a recording studio; in a Marketing company; two different Marketing companies; as a prepress guy doing Photoshop, etc; then back to another recording studio, this time as an engineer, a small step up from night watchman really; then moved the US and worked at a print shop, more Photoshop and prepress stuff; then as a phone tech support guy, horrible job but I learned a lot; then off to California to work in IT for Hitachi; after a while of that I moved to Europe without employment, started working in computer animation studio, we made 3 full-length films where I did mainly Modeling and Editing and I taught Autodesk Maya (the software we used to make the films) to students during 5 years; that ended and I went back to programming which is what I do now. I program for a living, I, unfortunately, don't write for a living.

### So you're not a professional author?

Nope.

### And you still expect me to read your crap?

Sure. Give it a chance. If you don't like it, you can close the page free of charge, guaranteed or your money back!

### What's the novel about?

About a guy who happens to be a cop. Read it and find out.
