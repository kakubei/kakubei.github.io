### What is this site?

It's a novel I'm writing, served up serialized, which is a fancy word for 'in chapters'. Apparently, it's all the rage nowadays, though it's nothing new, Charles Dickens did it way back in 1837 or thereabouts.

### So you're writing your novel in chapters like Dickens so people will compare you with him?

Yes! Actually no! I don't think it's a fair comparison by any stretch of the imagination. For Charlie of course. Ha.

Seriously though, nothing to do with Charlie, I'm writing it in chapters because it's not done yet so as I finish and edit the chapters I'll post them up here. It's also a great way to get feedback and for an unpublished 'author' to be known and get his work out there.

### What's with the dumb title?
We'll it started off as a joke, I'm going to write a Noir detective novel and I'm going to call it... Noir. Funny, right? Very toigue-in-cheeky. So the name just stuck. 

But it *is* a dumb title so I'll probably end up changing it at some point. Or not. If you've ever written anything longer than an email you are probably familiar with the love/hate relation you'll have for that pierce of writing. Or it doesn't just have to be writing, I've heard it happens in any creative capacity, it's happened to me with designs I've done and code I've written. Basically one day you go: 

"This is great! I love this! I've really outdone myself, I'm a fucking genius!"

The next day, or week, or whatever, you look at it and go:

"This is shit! Who Made this? They should be shot, I'm a fucking retard!"

Then next time:

"Hey, this isn't so bad, I can probably salvage it, I'm not a total loser after all."

Still later:

"Nope, I'm a fucking loser, this sucks, I suck."

And even later still:

"This is great! I love this! I've..."

You get the picture. Unless you're an unabashed megalomaniac, you will probably go through something like this for most of your creations, they say it's normal and that we're our own worst critics, that's why we always need a weathervane of some sort, so we don't go in either direction over the brink, thinking we suck or that we're geniuses, we have to be kept in check. Lest we end up like Ann Rice, her first novels were OK, when she still had an editor, they were readable. I confess that as a much younger man I enjoyed reading one or two, but then, after she got famous, she refused to let any editors near her work and it shows, it's just a run-on pile of crap, much like this paragraph.

That's why the title might stay, even though it's dumb, I'm in no capacity to judge.

### Why is this site so 'simple'

Because it's written in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) a really nice Ruby gem to create blogs. No PHP, no databases, no user authorization, just you and your words (after the struggle to get it running of course). You write all posts and pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want to) and use git to push the changes. Awesome.

### Who are you?

Just some random dude.

### Do I know you?

No.

### Have you published anything before?

No. That's what unpublished author means.

### So why should I read your crap?

Cause it's awesome? I don't know, fine, don't read it, bugger off. Or give it a try before you bugger off, you might like it. I'm writing the kind of novel I like to read, hopefully some other people like it too.

### But who are you really?

Alright, a little bio: I've done all sorts of things professionally. Worked as a tourist guide in the caribbean; then an English teacher; then a night watchman in a recording studio; in a Marketing company; two different Marketing companies; as a prepress guy doing Photoshop, etc; then back to another recording studio, this time as an engineer, a small step up from night watchman really; then moved the US and worked at a print shop, more Photoshop and prepress stuff; then as a phone tech support guy, horrible job but I learned a lot; then off to California to work in IT for Hitachi; after a while of that I moved to Europe without employment, started working in computer animation studio, we made 3 full-length films where I did mainly Modeling and Editing and I taught Autodesk Maya (the software we used to make the films) to students during 5 years; that ended and I went back to programming which is what I do now. I program for a living, I, unfortunately, don't write for a living.

### So you're not a professional author?

Nope.

### And you still expect me to read your crap?

Sure. Give it a chance. If you don't like it, you can close the page free of charge, guaranteed or your money back!

### What's the novel about?

About a guy who happens to be a cop. Read it and find out.
